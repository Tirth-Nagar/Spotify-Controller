# Spotify-Controller
 Spotify Controller is an exciting DIY project that empowers users to create a custom display module using an Orange Pi to control Spotify playback on their PC or other devices. The project interfaces with the Spotify API to showcase album art, song details, progress bar, and provide intuitive playback controls.
